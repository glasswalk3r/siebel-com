# siebel-com
siebel-com is an Perl API to add "syntax sugar" to connect to a Siebel application with Microsoft COM without having to go down the details of using Win32::OLE and COM concepts itself.

Inspiration for this distribution came from the [article](http://jbrazile.blogspot.com.br/2008/03/siebel-com-programming-with-perl.html) wrote by Jason Brazile and the wrong information in the documentation of Oracle saying that Perl cannot be used to connected to Siebel with COM:
