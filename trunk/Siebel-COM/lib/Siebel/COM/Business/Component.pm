=head1 NAME

Siebel::COM::Business:Component - Perl class to represent a Siebel COM Business Component

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  sub get_bus_comp {

      my $self    = shift;
      my $bc_name = shift;

      my $bc = Siebel::COM::Business::Component->new(
          { '_ole' => $self->get_ole()->GetBusComp($bc_name) } );

      return $bc;

  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Siebel::COM::Business::Component is the related class to Siebel Business Component classes.

Commom usage of this class is indirect since the object is recovered from a L<Siebel::COM::Business::Object> instance (see C<get_bus_comp> method
from it).

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

None besides the defined by the role L<Siebel::COM>.

=head2 METHODS

The methods listed below have exactly the same interface than those of Siebel COM API for Business Components:

=head3 activate_field 

Equal to ActivateField method, but also returns true if successful.

=head3 get_field_value 

Equal to GetFieldValue method.

=head3 clear_query

Equal to ClearToQuery method, but also returns true if successful.

=head3 set_search_exp

Equal to SetSearchExpr method.

=head3 set_search_spec

Equalt to SetSearchSpec method, but also returns true if successful.

=head3 get_search_spec

Equal to GetSearchSpec method.

=head3 first_record

Equal to FirstRecord method.

=head3 next_record

Equal to NextRecord method.

=head3 set_field_value

Equal to SetFieldValue method, but also returns true if successful.

=head3 write_record

Equal to WriteRecord method, but also returns true if successful.

=head3 set_search_expr

Equal to SetSearchExpr method.

=head3 invoke_method

Equal to InvokeMethod method.

The following methods have some interface differences from their Siebel COM counterparts:

=head3 query

Same thing as ExecuteQuery from Siebel COM API but it defined as default FORWARD_ONLY constant for cursor mode. It accepts a different value
for cursor mode although (must probably FORWARD_BACKWARD would be the choice for it).

=head3 set_view_mode

Same thing as SetViewMode from Siebel COM API but it defined as default ALL_VIEW constant for view mode. It accepts a different value
for it as defined by L<Siebel::COM::Constants>. Also, it returns true when successfully invoked.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head2 CONSTANTS

All constants from L<Siebel::COM::Constant> are available too. This class also executes the following related functions automatically.

=head3 FORWARD_ONLY

Applies as default value for C<query> method.

=head3 ALL_VIEW

Applies as default value for C<set_view_mode> method.
