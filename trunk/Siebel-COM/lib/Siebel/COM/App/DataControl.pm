=head1 DESCRIPTION

Siebel::COM::App::DataControl is a subclass of L<Siebel::COM::App>, providing access to the Siebel COM Data Control environment as well
as additional functionality.

Usually using Data Control is the preferable way to access Siebel with COM, but Siebel COM Data Server has it's advantages. Please check 
L<Siebel::COM::App::DataServer> for more details on that.

This class extends L<Siebel::COM::App> superclass, adding more attributees and methods or overriding the inherited ones as necessary.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 host

A string that holds the C<host> part of the connection string of Siebel COM Data Control.

The definition of this attribute during object creation is obligatory.

=head3 enterprise

A string that holds the C<enterprise> part of the connection string of Siebel COM Data Control.

The definition of this attribute during object creation is obligatory.

=head3 lang

A string that holds the language code to be used as part of the connection string of Siebel COM Data Control. This parameter is optional.

=head3 aom

A string that holds the C<AOM> part of the connection string of Siebel COM Data Control.

The definition of this attribute during object creation is obligatory.

=head3 transport

A string that holds the C<transport> part of the connection string of Siebel COM Data Control.

The definition of this attribute during object creation is optional, but defaults to "TCPIP".

=head3 encryption

A string that holds the C<encryption> part of the connection string of Siebel COM Data Control.

The definition of this attribute during object creation is optional, but defaults to "none".

=head3 compression

A string that holds the C<compression> part of the connection string of Siebel COM Data Control.

The definition of this attribute during object creation is optional, but defaults to "none".

=head3 connected

A boolean to indicate if the object instance is connected or not to a Siebel Enterprise.

It is not required during object creation and defaults to false (0). For obvious reasons, one should not use it to instantiate a new object.

This attribute is read-only.

=head3 ole_class

A string represeting the class name to be instantied by L<Win32::OLE>. It defaults to "SiebelDataControl.SiebelDataControl.1" and most 
probably you don't want to change that.

This attribute is read-only.

=head2 METHODS

All attributes defaults to have their getters/setters methods as the same name of the attribute, with some exceptions:

=over

=item *

ole_class is read-only

=item *

connected is read-only. The getter for it is C<is_connected>.

=back

Additionally by those defined by the superclass, this class have the following methods:

=head3 BUILD

Additionally by the superclass C<BUILD>, this methods automatically enables exceptions for errors during usage of Data Control.

=head3 get_conn_str

Returns a formatted string of the connection string used by Siebel COM Data Control to connect to a Siebel Enterprise through COM.

=head3 logoff

Executes the logoff of a Siebel Enterprise. Can be invoked anytime, but it will be invoked by default during object destruction if
C<is_connected> method returns true.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
