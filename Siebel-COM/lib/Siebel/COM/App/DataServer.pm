=head1 NAME

Siebel::COM::App::DataServer - Perl extension for connecting to a Siebel COM Data Server environment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   $sa = Siebel::COM::App::DataServer->new(
        {
            cfg         => $cfg,
            data_source => $datasource,
            user        => $user,
            password    => $password
        }
    );

    my ( $bo, $bc, $key, $field, $moreResults );

    $sa->login();

    foreach $key ( keys(%$schema) ) {

        $bo = $sa->get_bus_object($key);
        $bc = $bo->get_bus_comp($key);

        foreach $field ( @{ $schema->{$key} } ) {

            $bc->activate_field($field);

        }

        $bc->clear_query();
        $bc->query();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Siebel::COM::App::DataServer is a subclass of L<Siebel::COM::App>, providing access to the Siebel COM Data Server environment as well
as additional functionality.

Additionally to all architecture differences from L<Siebel::COM::App::DataControl>, this class have important difference about error treament: all
method calls requires a L<Win32::OLE::Variant> to be passed as a parameter for error checking, so all those procedures are executed internally.

To be able to do that, almost all methods inherited from L<Siebel::COM::App> are overloaded or overrided and a specific role 
(L<Siebel::COM::Exception::DataServer>) is applied.

Usually using L<Siebel::COM::App::DataControl> is preferable since it is faster to load and execute and can multiplex connections to a Siebel
Enterprise, but DataServer still have it's specific uses:

=over

=item 1.

Provides CRUD operations in the Siebel Client local database.

=item 2.

Avoid object restrictions in the Siebel Repository by using a local modified SRF.

=item 3.

Avoid security restrictions applied to the Siebel Enterprise, like firewalls and authentication.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 cfg

The complete path to the Siebel application configuration file. Required.

=head3 datasource

The datasource name as described in the file of C<cfg> attribute.

=head3 ole_class

Differently from the superclass, this attributes defaults to "SiebelDataServer.ApplicationObject". You probably don't want to change that, so
this attribute is not required during object creation.

=head3 get_bus_object

Overrided from superclass.

Expects a Business Object name as parameter.

Returns a L<Siebel::COM::Business::Object::DataServer> object. If the Business Object name does not exists in the repository, an exception is raised.

=head2 METHODS

=head3 BUILD

Additionally to the superclass operations, this method will call the C<load_objects> method automatically.

=head3 get_app_def

Returns a string as expected by the LoadObjects COM method from the C<ole_class>. It will validate if the C<cfg> can be read and will raise
and exception in the case it cannot.

=head3 load_objects

Same as COM LoadObjects method, but adding the proper error checking.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
